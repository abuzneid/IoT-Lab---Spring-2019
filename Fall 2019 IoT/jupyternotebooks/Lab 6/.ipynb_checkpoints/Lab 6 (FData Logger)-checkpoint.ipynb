    "This simple data logger takes regular light measurements with an analogue LDR (Photoresistor) and stores them in a text file on your Raspberry Pi. This data logger will measure and record the light level every second, enabling you to monitor how the brightness changes over a length of time. Later we send the data to ThingSpeak cloud platform and visualize the data."

To overcome this issue, you could use an Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC), or you could use a relatively cheap capacitor instead.\n"
